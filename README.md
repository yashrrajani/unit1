Random Quote Generator Project

    The goal of this web page is to generate a random quote based on user interaction with the webpage. Overall, I worked to establish the main components of a webpage, such as creating an array of quotes and its parts, styling the webpage, and adding additional elements.

    Specifically, I separated the big array of quotes into quotes about failure and mindset, putting all of the failure quotes at the beginning and putting the mindset quotes at the end. This allows me to have different getQuote() functions and different printQuote() functions based on the category of the quote.

    The hardest part of the project was styling and adding the new buttons to categorize the quotes, but overall, it was a lot of fun and provided me with a good challenge.
